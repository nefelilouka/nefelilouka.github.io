    <h2>Why does KWK Afterparty exist?</h2>
    <p>
 &#127800 Lack of diversity in Tech and STEM in general
    </br>
&#127800 Women feel overwhelmed and insecure entering the tech space
    </br>
&#127800 Despite its history, programming is considered a “man’s job”
  </br></br>
We want to take KWK’s vision further! With the camp, we have taken a big step, but the movement needs more than just two weeks of our time.
Our website will provide a “safe place” for every woman who has a passion for any STEM field and will build a support network.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="introduction">
    <h2>Who is our target audience?</h2>
    <p>
      
  </br>

    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="introduction">
    <h2>What does our website offer?</h2>
    <p>
      A platform with resources, inspiration and community:

<div class="STEM introduction">
  <h2> STEM Experience </h2>
  </br>
  <strong> Preparation of STEM Experts Who Can Make a Difference </strong>

<p> STEM education gives people skills that make them more employable and ready to meet the current labor demand. It encompasses the whole range of experiences and skills. Each STEM component brings a valuable contribution to a well-rounded education.</p>

    </br>

  <strong> STEM-Enhanced Teamwork and Communication</strong>  
<p>STEM education prepares the world for the future. It is based on teamwork and the collaboration of professionals from different disciplines. As a STEM student, you do not need to be an expert in each particular subject. You rather acquire a mindset that enables you to become a part of a highly qualified workforce, which functions in collaboration. Teamwork brings a significant increase in productivity, work satisfaction, and profitability. </p>
</br>

<p> There is a high demand for STEM skills in society. STEM education enables people to make informed decisions within the discussed subject areas. Moreover, STEM awareness is necessary for any job as most industries are more or less connected to science and technology. </p>
      </br>
  
<p>STEM subjects are focused on providing solutions to the concerns society has today. Human history had seen years of thoughtless exhaustion of natural resources. Such a lack of environmental education led to numerous challenges. These issues affect the health and well-being of all living organisms on our planet. Our environment needs protection. Thus, sustainability became one of the most urgent aspects studied by STEM disciplines.</p>
